# qc-software-project

qc-software is a project with the purpose of learning and practicing, which is still being developed. Development is overseen by [Saeed Gharedaghi](https://github.com/saeedghx68)

In this project, I used these technologies:

* `python` version: `3.11.4`
* `Django` version `4.2.2`
* `sqlite3` (to store the data)

Run
-----------
clone the project and write in terminal

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
After running the project, you can view the login page through the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/login. Of course, if you only go to port 8000, you will be redirected to the login page.

After authentication, you can see the main page with three options.
The options are:
* `SLABS`
* `BLOCKS`
* `TILES`
